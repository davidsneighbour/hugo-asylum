### Structure (Branches)

($ in front of a slug mean that the slug is not fixed and will vary over multiple branches)

- `main` - main branch with runnable testing suite and Hugo versions
- `testing/testing` - testing, testing, 1 2 3, used for development before being merged ino `main`
- `testing/$test-case-name` - branches with a single test case that depends on a fixed binary version
- `discourse/$thread-name` - branches with samples that are created for threads in https://discourse.gohugo.io
- `howto/$howto-name` - branches that explain one single thing
- `content` - branch for collecting content samples to cherry-pick between branches
- `templates/$template-name` - branches with repos set up for certain site types

### Binaries

**Configuration**: Check out the file `dotfiles/.releases.dist`. In it you find version numbers of hugo that will be
downloaded. To download different versions, then copy the file to `dotfiles/.releases` and edit to your needs.
 
**Download**: Run `./bin/gethugo.sh`, answer which versions (standard, extended or both) you want to download and lean 
back. It will take a while if you have many versions to download. The downloaded binaries will be saved inside the 
`bin/hugo` directory.

**ToDo**:

- Create a script that links the preferred hugo binary to hugo
- Create a script that runs through a list of versions and executes commands for each of these version.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why not use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for the binaries

Because the free tier has only available space of 1GB and I am using too many different binaries.
