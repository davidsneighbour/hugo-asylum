# An h1 header

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. _Italic_, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

- This one
- That one
- The other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs, if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... Will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. â˜º

## An h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

```
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
```

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

```python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print(i)
```

### An h3 header

Now a nested list:

1. First, get these ingredients:

- Carrots
- Celery
- Lentils

2. Boil some water.

3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a link to [a site](https://github.com) and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#h2-heading). Here's a footnote [^1].

[^1]: Some footnote text.

Tables can look like this:

Name Size Material Color

---

All Business 9 leather brown
Roundabout 10 hemp canvas natural
Cinderella 11 glass transparent

Table: Shoes sizes, materials, and colors.

(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports
multi-line tables:

---

Keyword Text

---

Red Sunsets, apples, and
other red or reddish
things.

Green Leaves, grass, frogs
and other things it's
not easy being.

---

A horizontal rule follows.

---

Here's a definition list:

Apples
: Good for making applesauce.

Oranges
: Citrus.

Tomatoes
: There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term and its definition to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block" (note how whitespace is honored):

| Line one
| Line too
| Line tree

And images can be specified like so:

![Example image](example-image.jpg "Exemplary image")

Inline math equation: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line like so:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

<!-- textlint-disable stop-words -->

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
that should be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.

<!-- textlint-enable stop-words -->

<!-- textlint-disable ruleA,ruleB -->
<!-- trunk-ignore(markdownlint/MD025) -->

# H1 Heading 8-)

<!-- textlint-enable ruleA,ruleB -->

## Lists

Unordered

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    - Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
- Very easy.

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

4. You can use sequential numbers...
5. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. Foo
1. Bar

## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code

Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

```js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```
